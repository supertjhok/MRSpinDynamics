# Tests

Tests should compare Python outputs against small MATLAB reference cases before
the Python API is treated as stable.

Initial validation targets:

1. `calc_time_domain_echo.m` on a small synthetic complex spectrum.
2. `sim_spin_dynamics_asymp_mag3.m` using the ideal CPMG quick-start inputs.
3. `sim_spin_dynamics_arb10.m` using the existing MATLAB benchmark parameters.
4. Probe-specific CPMG examples after the ideal path is stable.

Keep reference arrays small enough to commit as text or NumPy `.npz` fixtures.

## Test Tiers

Run the fast smoke tier during normal edit loops:

```powershell
python -m unittest tests.smoke_tests
```

Run the full MATLAB/Octave fixture validation before committing changes that
touch numerical behavior or public workflows:

```powershell
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

The smoke tier intentionally samples representative fixture, workflow, pulse,
and example checks. It is not a replacement for full validation.

Matched-probe SPA summary checks are intentionally kept out of the smoke tier
because each selected catalog pulse runs the matched-network transient solver.
